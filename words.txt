Raijin is often depicted with a fierce, frightening face and a muscular 
figure with gravity-defying hair. He is surrounded by Taiko drums that 
he plays to create the sound of thunder. Raijin holds large hammers in
his hands that he uses to play the drums. In some cases, Raijin is 
portrayed with three fingers which are said to represent the past, 
present and future. Two of the most notable sculptures of Raijin are 
located in the Sanjusangendo temple and the Taiyuin Rinnoji temple.
